<h1>Weather Web App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a weather web app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app has informations about the weather in all major cities around the world by using a weather API. You can search a city and it will appear the forecast for today, the next 5 days and a photo of the city. You can also add cities to a favourites list, so that you can navigate through their weather just by clicking on the list and you dont have to search the city again.
